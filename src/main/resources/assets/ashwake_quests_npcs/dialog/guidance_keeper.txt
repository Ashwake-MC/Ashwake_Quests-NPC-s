ASHWAKE - GUIDANCE KEEPER DIALOGUE

"So... you survived the awakening."

"You feel it, don't you? The weight in the air. The stillness between heartbeats. That is Ashwake."

Long before you arrived, this world burned.

Not by dragonfire. Not by war.

By ambition.

Civilizations rose too quickly. They reached beyond their grasp -- into magic they did not understand and machines they could not control. The sky split. The ground swallowed cities. What remained did not die...

It fractured.

What you stand in now is not merely a world.

It is a world divided into Ages.

THE FIVE AGES

"You cannot rush this place."

Ashwake does not allow it.

There are Five Ages, each one representing a stage of power, knowledge, and control over the world around you. You do not simply unlock them -- you prove yourself worthy of them.

Each Age demands three things of you:

Understanding. Strength. Mastery.

You will begin with almost nothing -- tools of wood, fire for warmth, and your instincts. But as you progress, you will unlock greater technologies, deeper magic, and more dangerous frontiers.

To move from one Age to the next, you must complete its trials:

- Master its crafting methods
- Build what that civilization would have built
- Defeat the guardians that block its knowledge
- Establish infrastructure strong enough to sustain growth

If you attempt to skip ahead...

The world will resist you.

A WORLD THAT DEMANDS EXPLORATION

"You see only the surface."

Beyond these forests lie shattered kingdoms buried in vines. Beneath your feet are ruins of metal and arcane crystal. In distant lands, corrupted beasts roam territories warped by forgotten experiments.

You will not progress by standing still.

You will travel.

You will search abandoned structures for fragments of lost knowledge. You will uncover dungeons where failed creations still guard their masters' secrets. You will cross into places where the air itself feels wrong.

Some materials cannot be found near safety.

Some answers require risk.

THE NECESSITY OF AUTOMATION

"At first, you will work with your hands."

You will mine. Chop. Craft. Smelt.

But Ashwake was not broken by simple tools.

It was broken by industry.

As you move through the Ages, survival alone will no longer be enough. Resources will demand refinement. Machines will demand fuel. Progress will demand efficiency.

You will learn to:

- Harness mechanical power
- Create automated farms and resource systems
- Build processing chains that run without your touch
- Generate and control energy
- Construct machines that dwarf your first campfire

Manual labor feeds survival.

Automation feeds progress.

And without progress...

You will remain small in a world that grows more dangerous.

THE GUARDIANS OF EACH AGE

"Power is never unguarded."

Each Age is sealed -- not by doors, but by beings that embody that era's might.

Some are ancient beasts mutated by early experiments. Some are constructs forged of metal and flame. Some are remnants of magic that refused to fade.

You will not simply craft your way forward.

You must conquer.

Only when the guardian of an Age falls, and its lessons are completed, will the next path reveal itself.

YOUR BEGINNING - THE WOODEN AGE

"But all of that is distant."

Every empire begins with timber.

Your journey starts in the Wooden Age -- the Age of Foundations.

Here you will learn the basics of structured survival:

- Primitive tools and crafting discipline
- Early building techniques
- Foundational resource gathering
- The mindset required for structured progression

This Age is not about power.

It is about understanding your place in the world.

If you cannot master wood and stone...

You will never command steel and energy.

SEEK ORIN HOLLOWMERE

"There is one who will guide you."

His name is Orin Hollowmere.

He remembers fragments of the first collapse and has dedicated himself to ensuring it does not happen again.

Orin will test you.

He will not hand you power.

He will teach you how to build it.

Complete his trials. Lay your foundations properly. Show that you understand patience and preparation.

When you have mastered the Wooden Age...

Return.

The second Age will be waiting.

"Ashwake does not reward haste."

"It rewards those who endure."

Now go.

Find Orin Hollowmere.
