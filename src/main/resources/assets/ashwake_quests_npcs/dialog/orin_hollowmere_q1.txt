QUEST 1 - THE KEEPER OF BEGINNINGS

So... the Guidance has sent you.
You stand at the root of something vast.
Welcome to Ashwake.
This world does not unfold all at once. It grows.

POWER AND AGES

Power is not taken. It is earned.
You begin in the Wooden Age.
The age of fiber. Of binding. Of foundations.
Every Age you unlock reshapes your world.
